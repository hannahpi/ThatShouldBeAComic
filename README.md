# ThatShouldBeAComic
A webcomic forum built on the LAMP stack.  This website is currently live at http://tsbac.dreamersnet.net.  I plan on working on
both the website and creating a generalized version of it.

# About the Project
This project was started in 2010 and received many updates until 2013.  After that the site went into remission and was no longer
used.  Now I'm bringing it back in hopes of showcasing this beautiful mess of code.  I hope to update it and make it less of a mess.
I also hope someone finds it useful in some way.

# Prerequisites
This project requires:
- cimage from https://github.com/mosbth/cimage (image resizer, server side)
- jquery (an older version was used but I'd assume it'd be compatible with the current one as well)
- excanvas (looks like it's a Google Project from 2006 it may not be relevant now since canvas has more support)
- mysql database (or the like)
- webserver with php7 installed

# Issues
You may submit issues for either this repository or the website.  Please make sure you note which one you are referring to.
